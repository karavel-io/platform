  # Identity allocation mode selects how identities are shared between cilium
  # nodes by setting how they are stored. The options are "crd" or "kvstore".
  # - "crd" stores identities in kubernetes as CRDs (custom resource definition).
  #   These can be queried with:
  #     kubectl get ciliumid
  # - "kvstore" stores identities in a kvstore, etcd or consul, that is
  #   configured below. Cilium versions before 1.6 supported only the kvstore
  #   backend. Upgrades from these older cilium versions should continue using
  #   the kvstore by commenting out the identity-allocation-mode below, or
  #   setting it to "kvstore".

  # If you want cilium monitor to aggregate tracing for packets, set this level
  # to "low", "medium", or "maximum". The higher the level, the less packets
  # that will be seen in monitor output.

  # The monitor aggregation interval governs the typical time between monitor
  # notification events for each allowed connection.

  # Only effective when monitor aggregation is set to "medium" or higher.

  bpf-lb-map-max: "65536"
  # Pre-allocation of map entries allows per-packet latency to be reduced, at
  # the expense of up-front memory allocation for the entries in the maps. The
  # default value below will minimize memory usage in the default installation;
  # users who are sensitive to latency may consider setting this to "true".
  #
  # This option was introduced in Cilium 1.4. Cilium 1.3 and earlier ignore
  # this option and behave as though it is set to "true".
  #
  # If this value is modified, then during the next Cilium startup the restore
  # of existing endpoints and tracking of ongoing connections may be disrupted.
  # As a result, reply packets may be dropped and the load-balancing decisions
  # for established connections may change.
  #
  # If this option is set to "false" during an upgrade from 1.3 or earlier to
  # 1.4 or later, then it may cause one-time disruptions during the upgrade.
